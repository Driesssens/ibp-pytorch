# pytorch-ibp

This is a PyTorch implementation of the imagination-based planner (IBP) architecture from DeepMind's "Learning model-based planning from scratch" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06170). It also contains an approximate implementation of their Spaceship 2.0 task as an OpenAI Gym environment.

Note that this implementation doesn't necessarily aim to replicate exactly the results from the original paper.
